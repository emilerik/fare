/*#### Day 45/100: 1:20 // face recognition app
I started working on a big project in the course - the face recognition app. It's a website where you can log in, and then paste a URL with an image - it then finds faces on the image and marks them with rectangles. So far, I've basically just built some of the basic components, and a background. Tomorrow, I will hopefully finish the components so I can implement the face detection API.*/
